## In The Media

### Privacy Guides

“After using their platform for the past few weeks, I can comfortably write that Hush Line accomplishes its mission astoundingly well. Not only is customer support excellent for enterprise users, but its integration with PGP encrypted email makes it a lifesaver for a Thunderbird user like me. The ability to receive encrypted notifications via email is honestly an underrated feature.”

### Newsweek

“Investing in technology that protects privacy—such as Hush Line and Signal—is also important in sharing information that is anonymous, and can't be subpoenaed.”<br>

### TIME

"Psst’s safe is based on Hush Line, a tool designed by the nonprofit Science & Design, Inc., as a simpler way for sources to reach out to journalists and lawyers. It’s a one-way conversation system, essentially functioning as a tip-line. Micah Lee, an engineer on Hush Line, says that the tool fills a gap in the market for an encrypted yet accessible central clearinghouse for sensitive information."<br>

### Podcasts

"I'm working with a a non-profit software company called Science and Design that's worked on a number of really interesting products that are kind of nerdy and more on the journalism space, but they're working on something called Hush Line, which is a one-way encrypted anonymizing platform so that whistleblowers can reach out to individual journalists while remaining anonymous... it provides a non-technical person a way and a path and information, should they find themselves in a whistleblowing position, to not mitigate the danger because it's never not going to be dangerous, but prepare them for the process and give them an easy-to-use modern tool to responsibly disclose information to trustworthy journalists..."<br>
