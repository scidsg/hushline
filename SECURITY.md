# Security Policy

Thanks for helping keep Hush Line safe. We welcome responsible disclosure of
security vulnerabilities.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Preferred: submit a report via GitHub Security Advisories for this repository.

If you cannot use GitHub Security Advisories, message our security contact:

- `https://tips.hushline.app/to/hushline-security`

Please include:

- A clear description of the issue and potential impact.
- Steps to reproduce (proof-of-concept if available).
- Affected versions/branches, if known.
- Any mitigation ideas you may have.

## Response Targets

We aim to:

- Acknowledge reports within 3 business days.
- Provide a status update within 10 business days.
- Coordinate a fix and disclosure timeline based on severity and complexity.

These are best-effort targets, not guarantees.

## Scope

In scope:

- Vulnerabilities in this repository’s code.
- Issues affecting deployed instances that are directly caused by this code.

Out of scope:

- Denial of service against public endpoints without a practical exploit path.
- Spam or social engineering attacks.
- Vulnerabilities in third-party services or infrastructure not controlled by us.

## Safe Harbor

We will not pursue legal action against researchers who:

- Act in good faith.
- Avoid privacy violations and data destruction.
- Use minimal data access necessary to confirm a vulnerability.
- Give us reasonable time to remediate before public disclosure.

## Disclosure

We prefer coordinated disclosure. We’ll work with you to determine a reasonable
timeline for fixes and public communication.
