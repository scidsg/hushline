# Dark Mode

Source: <https://hushline.app/library/docs/using-your-tip-line/dark-mode/>

Hush Line supports dark mode automatically.

## How it works

The web app responds to your system or browser `prefers-color-scheme` setting. There is no separate in-app theme toggle required for normal use.

## What to expect

- light mode when your device prefers light appearance
- dark mode when your device prefers dark appearance
- matching browser theme-color metadata for supported devices

## If dark mode does not appear

- confirm your operating system or browser is set to dark appearance
- refresh the page after changing the system theme
- make sure you are not forcing a light-only reader mode or extension
