# Tools

Hush Line includes browser-facing tools that help recipients evaluate evidence and extract useful text without leaving the product workflow.

## Available tools

- [Email Validation](./email-validation.md)
- [Vision Assistant](./vision-assistant.md)

## When to use them

- Use Email Validation when you need to inspect raw email headers and judge whether an email appears authentic.
- Use Vision Assistant when you have screenshots or photos and need searchable text for review.

## Why they matter

These tools support tip-handling work that often happens next to message review:

- checking whether a claimed sender identity holds up
- turning image-heavy evidence into searchable text
