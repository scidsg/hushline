Vision Assistant is Hush Line's browser-based OCR tool.

## What it is for

Use it when a source gives you images and you need searchable text from them, such as:

- screenshots
- photographed documents
- pictures of handwritten or printed notes

## Privacy model

The OCR flow runs in the browser. The app copy describes this tool as not sending image data to Hush Line servers.

## Current limitations

- English only
- best suited to readable images with clear contrast

## How to use it

1. Open the tool.
2. Add one or more image files.
3. Wait for OCR to complete in the browser.
4. Review and reuse the extracted text in your reporting or case workflow.
