# Reading Messages

Source: <https://hushline.app/library/docs/using-your-tip-line/reading-messages/>

Opening a message takes you from the inbox list into the full submission view.

## What a message can contain

Messages are made of field values. Depending on how the recipient profile is configured, those fields may be:

- encrypted
- unencrypted
- required
- optional

Encrypted values are shown in their encrypted form until you decrypt them with your PGP workflow.

## What you can do from the message view

- review the submission fields
- change the message status
- resend the message to email if that delivery mode is enabled
- delete the message

## Notes on encrypted content

- If your tip line uses encrypted fields, plan your decryption workflow before publishing.
- If you rely on email delivery, configure those notification settings in advance.
- Unencrypted fields are easier to read immediately, but they expose more information to the hosting environment.
