# Message Statuses

Source: <https://hushline.app/library/docs/using-your-tip-line/message-statuses/>

Message statuses help you organize tips internally and explain progress back to your community.

## Built-in statuses

- `Waiting`
- `Accepted`
- `Declined`
- `Archived`

## What you can customize

In `Settings` -> `Message Statuses`, you can edit the explanatory text attached to each status. Hush Line supports Markdown for that text.

This is useful when you want to explain:

- how long a source should expect to wait
- what "accepted" means in your workflow
- when a case is out of scope
- what archived means for follow-up

## How statuses affect the workflow

- The inbox uses statuses as filter tabs.
- Individual messages can be reassigned from the message view.
- Clear status text reduces uncertainty for sources checking back on their submission.

## Default meanings

- `Waiting`: received and pending review
- `Accepted`: actively being considered or pursued
- `Declined`: reviewed but not moving forward
- `Archived`: closed for now
