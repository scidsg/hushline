# Your Inbox

Source: <https://hushline.app/library/docs/using-your-tip-line/your-inbox/>

Your inbox is where every incoming tip arrives.

## What you see

Each message row shows:

- which username received the message
- the date it was created
- a link to open the full message

If you have no messages yet, Hush Line shows an empty-state screen instead.

## Filter by status

Inbox tabs let you filter messages by status, including:

- `All`
- `Waiting`
- `Accepted`
- `Declined`
- `Archived`

Those filters are useful once your tip line is active and you need a simple triage view.

## Typical workflow

1. Open the inbox regularly.
2. Filter by status when you want to focus on unresolved items.
3. Open a message to review its fields and change its status.

Continue with [Reading Messages](./reading-messages.md) for the per-message workflow.
