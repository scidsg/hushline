# Account Verification

Source: <https://hushline.app/library/docs/using-your-tip-line/account-verification/>

Account verification is a trust signal for sources. Verified accounts display a badge that tells visitors the person behind the tip line has been verified by Hush Line staff.

## Why verification matters

When a source is deciding whether to share sensitive information, they need confidence that the profile really belongs to the intended recipient. Verification helps reduce impersonation risk in the public directory and on public profile pages.

## What verification looks like

- a `Verified` badge on the public profile
- placement in the directory's verified view when that view is enabled

## Related trust signals

Verification works best when paired with:

- a complete public profile
- consistent naming across your website and social accounts
- links to public identities you control
