This is the shortest path to a usable Hush Line account. In practice, most people need to do four things:

1. Set up their public profile so sources know who they reached.
2. Add a PGP key so incoming tips can be encrypted for them.
3. Decide how they want new-tip notifications delivered.
4. Publish their tip-line link where their community will actually see it.

## Recommended order

1. Complete [New User Onboarding](./new-user-onboarding.md) if you want the guided flow.
2. Read [Prep Your Account](./prep-your-account.md) to finish profile, encryption, and directory basics.
3. Read [Secure Your Account](./secure-your-account.md) before sharing the link widely.
4. Read [Share Your Tip Line](./share-your-tip-line.md) when you are ready to publish it.

## What you need before tips can arrive safely

- A public-facing identity: display name, short bio, and any extra profile details you want sources to use
- A PGP key: Proton Mail is the easiest path for many users, but manual public-key paste also works
- A plan for notifications: web inbox only, email notice only, or email delivery with encrypted content
- A distribution plan: public directory listing, direct profile link, or both
