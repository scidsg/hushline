# New User Onboarding

Source: <https://hushline.app/library/docs/getting-started/new-user-onboarding/>

Hush Line includes a four-step guided setup flow. You can skip it and finish later in Settings, but the guide is the fastest way to reach a usable tip line.

## Step 1: profile

Add the basics a source needs to recognize you:

- display name
- short bio
- optional directory presence

Use the same name people already associate with your work.

## Step 2: encryption

Add a public PGP key so only you can read encrypted submissions.

Two supported paths:

- Proton Mail key lookup
- manual public-key paste

If you are using Proton Mail, Hush Line can look up your public key for you.

## Step 3: notifications

Choose where new tips should be sent. Hush Line works best when you add an email address for notifications. If you imported a Proton key in the previous step, using the same address makes email delivery easier to manage.

## Step 4: directory visibility

Choose whether to appear in the public user directory. Directory listings help whistleblowers discover your tip line, and you can change this setting later.

## After onboarding

- Continue with [Prep Your Account](./prep-your-account.md) for the settings you may still want to tune.
- Continue with [Secure Your Account](./secure-your-account.md) before broad distribution.
