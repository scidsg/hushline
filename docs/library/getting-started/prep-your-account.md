# Prep Your Account

Source: <https://hushline.app/library/docs/getting-started/account-setup/>

Preparing your account means getting your profile, encryption, and message-delivery settings into a state you are comfortable publishing.

## 1. Fill in your public profile

At minimum, add:

- a recognizable display name
- a short bio
- any extra profile details you want sources to trust, such as a website or Signal handle

If you opt into the public directory, this is the information whistleblowers will use to decide whether your tip line belongs to the right person.

## 2. Add encryption

If tips will be delivered to an email address, PGP setup is the important step.

Supported options:

- Proton Mail key lookup
- manual public-key paste

Without a PGP key, people can still see your profile, but they cannot submit tips through it.

## 3. Decide how messages should reach you

Hush Line can notify you about new tips in the web inbox and, optionally, by email. In Settings you can:

- enable or disable email notifications
- include encrypted message content in those emails
- encrypt the entire email body for compatibility with clients such as Proton Mail or Thunderbird

## 4. Review your public form

If you use custom message fields, decide which ones are:

- required or optional
- encrypted or unencrypted

Unencrypted custom fields are visible to you and your hosting provider. Encrypted fields require your PGP workflow to read them.

## 5. Choose whether to appear in the directory

Turning on directory visibility makes your tip line easier to find. If you want stronger trust signals, pair this with [Account Verification](../using-your-tip-line/account-verification.md).
