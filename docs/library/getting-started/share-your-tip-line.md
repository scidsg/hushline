# Share Your Tip Line

Source: <https://hushline.app/library/docs/getting-started/share-your-tip-line/>

Once your account is configured, make it easy for sources to find the right link and recognize it as yours.

## Places to publish it

- your public Hush Line directory listing
- your website or newsroom profile page
- your email signature
- your social media bios
- printed material such as flyers, cards, or event handouts

## Best practices

- Share the exact profile URL from your browser address bar.
- Keep your display name and bio aligned with your public identity elsewhere.
- If you have a website or social account, link both directions when possible.
- Consider [Account Verification](../using-your-tip-line/account-verification.md) if trust is especially important for your audience.

## If you use the public directory

Directory visibility can help people discover you, but it should not be your only distribution channel. Many users also publish the direct tip-line URL on channels they already control.

## After you publish

- Watch [Your Inbox](../using-your-tip-line/your-inbox.md) for new tips.
- Learn the review flow in [Reading Messages](../using-your-tip-line/reading-messages.md).
