# Secure Your Account

Source: <https://hushline.app/library/docs/getting-started/secure-your-account/>

Before you publish your tip line, make sure the account behind it is hard to take over.

## Use a strong password

Start with a unique password you do not reuse anywhere else. Your tip line is only as trustworthy as the account protecting it.

## Enable two-factor authentication

Hush Line supports TOTP-based 2FA.

1. Open `Settings` -> `Authentication`.
2. Choose `Enable 2FA`.
3. Scan the QR code with your authenticator app or enter the text code manually.
4. Verify with the six-digit code to finish setup.

Once enabled, logins require both your password and the current TOTP code.

## Secure the email account tied to notifications

If tips are forwarded to your inbox, that email account becomes part of your security boundary. Apply the same care there:

- use a strong password
- enable 2FA on the mail account too
- restrict who can access the mailbox

## Protect your verification and public identity signals

Changing a verified username or display name can affect trust signals shown to sources. Make identity changes deliberately, especially after you have already published your tip line.
