# The Hush Line Personal Server

Source: <https://hushline.app/library/docs/personal-server/the-hush-line-personal-server/>

The Hush Line Personal Server is the self-hosted Hush Line appliance. It is designed for people who want the Hush Line workflow on hardware they control while still giving sources an anonymous, browser-based submission path.

## How access works

The Personal Server presents two addresses:

- a Tor onion address for private access through Tor Browser
- a local-network HTTPS address for access from the network the device is connected to

The in-app server info page shows both addresses directly on the device.

## First-run setup

1. Visit the device address.
2. Register the first account.
3. The first user created on a Personal Server becomes the admin.
4. Add your profile, encryption key, and notification settings.
5. Share the onion URL publicly so sources can reach you anonymously.

## Who it is for

The product copy describes the Personal Server as a good fit for lawyers, journalists, educators, and business leaders who want a safer reporting channel for their communities.
