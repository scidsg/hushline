# Welcome to Hush Line

Source basis: the public Hush Line Library welcome section and the project overview in [README.md](../../../README.md).

Hush Line is an open source whistleblower platform for secure, anonymous, one-way disclosures. It is built for journalists, lawyers, educators, organizers, employers, and other trusted recipients who need a safer way to receive tips from their communities.

## What Hush Line is designed to protect

- Anonymous submissions without requiring a sender account
- End-to-end encrypted delivery when the receiver has a PGP key
- Trust-building signals such as verified accounts and public profile details
- Safer access paths, including Tor support and privacy-preserving defaults

## Common ways people use it

- Publish a public tip line for your newsroom, law office, classroom, campaign, or company
- Receive messages in a web inbox without turning the sender flow into a live chat
- Share a directory listing or direct profile link so sources can verify they reached the right person
- Run the hosted service or use a [Personal Server](../personal-server/the-hush-line-personal-server.md)

## Where to begin

- New hosted-service users should start with [Start Here](../getting-started/start-here.md).
- If you want the guided setup flow, open [New User Onboarding](../getting-started/new-user-onboarding.md).
- If you already have an account, jump to [Prep Your Account](../getting-started/prep-your-account.md) and [Secure Your Account](../getting-started/secure-your-account.md).
