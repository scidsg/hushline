Issue #: ${ISSUE_NUMBER}
Title: ${ISSUE_TITLE}

Task:
- If the change affects backend logic, authentication, CSP, crypto, or any critical path: 
  * Write minimal pytest tests that reproduce the issue or define the requested feature.
  * Implement the smallest change to pass tests.
- If the change is limited to styles, markup, or static assets (e.g., CSS, HTML, images), 
  * Implement the change directly with no test required.
- Preserve public APIs and security posture (CSP, TOTP, Tor, crypto).
- Use repository conventions (pytest, Black/isort). No new services/env vars.

Output rules:
- Return unified diffs only (no prose).
- If touching auth/CSP/crypto, include tests hardening those paths.
